i want to write a small poc that helps me achieve dynamically generated ui through an llm's ouptut. i have learnt about a protocol being defined at this URL: https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui

i want to build a very small poc with python backend and a very simple node frontend. I would like to be able to have a very easy way to try out a few different kinds of UI objects on the screen.
